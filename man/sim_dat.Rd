\usage{
sim_dat(
  N = 1000,
  Time = 15,
  beta = 1,
  gamma = 0.7,
  seed = NULL,
  prob_treat = 0.25

  N = 1000,
  Time = 15,
  beta = 1,
  gamma = 0,
  seed = NULL,
  perc_never = 0.2,
  perc_treat = 0.8,
  perc_always = 1 - perc_treat - perc_never,
  timing_treatment = 2:Time
)
}
\arguments{
\item{N}{number of distinct units}

\item{Time}{number of distinct time}

\item{beta}{coef}

\item{gamma}{To generate the series \code{y_asym}, which has longer dynamics.
Gamma is the coefficients for observations that were not treated (0) the previous period,
while the standard beta will apply for values currently treated.}

\item{seed}{seed}

\item{prob_treat}{Probability of treatment}

\item{perc_never, perc_always, perc_treat}{\emph{Staggered:} Percentage of (during-sample) treated, never and always}

\item{timing_treatment}{\emph{Staggered:} In what periods can treatment start?}
